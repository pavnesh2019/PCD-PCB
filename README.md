so i solved 3A using loop method
which turns led on and of at delay of 5 microseconds. so it has a duty cycle of 50%.

there is one more code for 3A which i got from "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM" which i couldn't understand but trying to figure it out.what i understood till now is that is internally controll the flow of current at larger freqencies, higher than analogWrite() function. this code also has a duty cycle of 50% which can be changed by changing the value of just one variable.
